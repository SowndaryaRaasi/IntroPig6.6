                                        Assignment 6.6

1.Explain the difference between FIFO and Capacity scheduler
  Scheduler:
       *A scheduler is the one which schedules allocation of resources to the applications Or jobs.
   FIFO Scheduler:
       *FIFO stands for First In First Out .
       *A FIFO scheduler allocates resources to the applications or the jobs that come at first.
       *The job that is submitted first is allocated all the resources and the job  submitted later has to wait for the resources.
       *Even though the next coming job is smaller than the 1st one, it has to wait until job1 is finished.Only then, resources are allocated to job2.
       *Time of completion of all the jobs is more.
  Capacity Scheduler:
     *It allocates resources to applications based on the size of the job.
     *Smaller job is allocated resources first and after its completion, resources are  then given to the next smaller job.
     *Improves efficiency.
     *Reduces the time of completion of jobs.

        
    

2.What are the limitations of hadoop 1.x and how they were overcome in hadoop 2.x
   Limitations of hadoop 1.x:
       *Single node failure.If the name node fails, the whole HDFS gets down.
       *Suitable for a maximum of 4000 nodes and 40000 tasks.
       *TaskTracker is configured with static slots.Map tasks cannot run on reduce slot
         So,cluster utilisation is low.
       *Supports only map reduce processing model.
  Hadoop 2.x:
      *Multiple namenodes are introduced inorder to overcome single node failure.
      *It can scale upto 10000 nodes and 100000 tasks.
      *Resources are dynamic and fine-grained.BEtter cluster utilisation.
      *Supports processing models other than map reduce.
      *Overhead of work of namenode is reduced.
